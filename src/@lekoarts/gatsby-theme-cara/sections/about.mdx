> You know how it feels when you're at a crossroads, burdened by the urgency of choice, and you go the wrong way?

That was me with physics. It was two years before I realized cybersecurity was the right path for me. Why? Because it's desirable, interesting, and let's me actually have a life and achieve goals outside of work. I won't lie: I'm a pretty normal person, but I'm also an optimist in that I believe I can achieve everything I want.

I want to help businesses keep their data safe. I want to help protect the everyday person using a computer. I want to proudly display all my programming projects because they're just that cool. I want to apply for the first cybersecurity position on Mars. 
I want to finish coding my automated hydroponic garden system so I can be "that guy" at parties. I want to travel Europe all over again, armed with my photography equipment and my fiance.

Most importantly, I want to help wherever I can so that everyone gets what they want. 

So, what do *you* want - and how can I help you achieve it?
